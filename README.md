# Document Similarity

This repository contains a C++ program that demonstrates document similarity using sets and vectors. The program reads text from a file and calculates similarity coefficients between documents based on common words.

## Files

- `CMakeLists.txt`: CMake configuration file for building the project.
- `cmake-build-debug/`: Folder containing build artifacts (generated by CMake).
- `text.txt`: Example input file used by the main program (`Document Similarity.cpp`).
- `Document Similarity.cpp`: C++ source code file implementing the document similarity functionality.

## Description

The main program, `Document Similarity.cpp`, utilizes sets and vectors to represent and process strings from a text file (`text.txt`). It calculates the similarity between different sets of strings using the binary cosine coefficient. Here are some key functionalities of the program:

- **StringSet Class**: Represents a set of strings with methods to add, remove, clear, print, and calculate similarity.
- **Operators Overloading**: Overloaded operators `+` for set union and `*` for set intersection.
- **Similarity Calculation**: Computes similarity between two StringSet objects based on common elements.

## Usage

To run the program:
1. Compile `Document Similarity.cpp` using a C++ compiler.
2. Ensure `text.txt` is present in the same directory.
3. Execute the compiled binary.

Example usage:
```bash
$ g++ Document\ Similarity.cpp -o document_similarity
$ ./document_similarity
```
